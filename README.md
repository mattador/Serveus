# Serveus

Serveus is an experimental PHP "toolkit" developed by Matthew Cooper that aims to be light, modular and scalable. 
Serveus is designed to be a good starting point for simple web projects.

If you want to help improve Serveus or leave any feedback, please [contact me][1] and
visit my [website][2].

I would really like to know if anyone ends up using this, so please let me know if you do :).
